# Description
A simple stopwatch component with buttons to start, stop, and reset.  

The Start button starts the timer, and does nothing if the timer is already running.
The Stop button stops the timer if it is already running, and does nothing if the timer is not currently ticking.
The Reset button resets the timer to zero but does NOT stop the timer from continuing to tick if it is already running.
The Stop and Reset button both resets the timer to zero and stops the timer if it is currently running.
